## Tech Stack
**Navigation component :** one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.

**Email authentication:** making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.
 
**Firebase:** Save login id and messages of user in Realtime Firebase.

**View binding:** instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

**Coroutines:** do some code in the background.
